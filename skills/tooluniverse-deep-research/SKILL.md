name: tooluniverse-deep-research
description: >-
  Iterative research agent that thinks across databases. Searches, analyzes,
  hypothesizes, cross-references, and iterates until the picture is complete.
  Produces evidence-graded reports with citations. Use for multi-hop scientific
  questions, connection mapping (gene-pathway-drug-trial), comprehensive reviews
  spanning multiple domains, or any query requiring cross-database reasoning.
  NOT for single tool lookups (/tooluniverse) or literature-only reviews
  (/tooluniverse-literature-deep-research).

# Deep Research

Iterative, entity-driven research across 1,900+ life-science tools. Not a tool finder -- a research agent that thinks.

## When to Use

- "Deep research on [topic]"
- "Map the connections between [X] and [Y]"
- "What connects [gene] to [disease]?"
- "Comprehensive analysis of [entity]"
- "Investigate [multi-entity question]"
- "Cross-reference [drug] with [targets/trials/safety]"
- Any question requiring data from 3+ databases
- Any question where the answer depends on connections between entities

## When NOT to Use

| Need | Use instead |
|------|-------------|
| Find a tool | /tooluniverse |
| Literature review | /tooluniverse-literature-deep-research |
| Disease profile | /tooluniverse-disease-research |
| Drug profile | /tooluniverse-drug-research |
| Target profile | /tooluniverse-target-research |
| Company intelligence | /company-research |

If the question fits neatly in one domain, use the domain skill. Use deep research when the question spans domains or requires cross-referencing.

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Parse and Plan

1. **Extract entities** from the user's question: genes, drugs, diseases, pathways, companies, variants
2. **Classify question type**: treatment landscape, connection mapping, mechanism investigation, competitive analysis, safety review
3. **Check tool health** before planning searches:
   - Use `grep_tools` or `find_tools` to identify relevant tools
   - For each planned tool, check `ToolHealthCache().is_live(tool_name)`
   - If broken, consult fallback chains in [references/follow-the-data.md](references/follow-the-data.md)
4. **Create output files**:
   - `research_state.json` -- working memory (see [references/research-loop.md](references/research-loop.md))
   - `{topic}_deep_research.md` -- report file initialized with template from Output Format below

### Phase 2: Broad Search

Run 5-10 tool calls across complementary databases. Always use the discover-inspect-execute pattern:

```
1. grep_tools(pattern="relevant keyword") or find_tools(query="what I need")
2. get_tool_info(tool_names="discovered_tool")  -- NEVER skip this
3. execute_tool(tool_name="discovered_tool", arguments={...})
```

Typical first-pass tools by entity type:

| Entity in query | Start with |
|----------------|------------|
| Gene/protein | OpenTargets, STRING, UniProt, PubMed |
| Drug/compound | ChEMBL, PubChem, ClinicalTrials, FAERS |
| Disease | OpenTargets, ClinicalTrials, PubMed, HPO |
| Pathway | KEGG, Reactome, OpenTargets |
| Company | SEC EDGAR, ClinicalTrials, PubMed, FDA |
| Variant | ClinVar, CIViC, gnomAD, GWAS Catalog |

After each search: extract new entities, record in research_state.json, update report.

### Phase 3: Deepen and Cross-Reference

This is where the thinking happens.

1. **Resolve entity IDs** across databases (see [references/entity-resolution.md](references/entity-resolution.md))
2. **Map connections** between all discovered entities (see [references/cross-reference.md](references/cross-reference.md))
3. **Form hypotheses**: "Gene X is in pathway Y which is targeted by drug Z -- does Z have trials for the disease?"
4. **Validate hypotheses** with targeted searches: ClinicalTrials, FAERS, ClinVar, PubMed
5. **Follow unexpected connections** -- if the data leads somewhere surprising, chase it (see [references/follow-the-data.md](references/follow-the-data.md))

Update research_state.json after each sub-step. Update the report progressively.

### Phase 4: Synthesize

1. **Grade all evidence** using the T1-T4 framework (see [references/evidence-grading.md](references/evidence-grading.md))
2. **Resolve hypotheses**: mark each as confirmed, refuted, or inconclusive with supporting evidence
3. **Document gaps**: what couldn't be found and why
4. **Write executive summary**: 3-5 sentences capturing the key findings
5. **Finalize report**: ensure every claim is cited, every table has a Source column

## Output Format

Create `{topic}_deep_research.md` at the start. Populate progressively.

```markdown
# Deep Research Report: {Topic}

**Generated**: {date}
**Question**: {original user question}
**Iterations**: {N}

## Executive Summary

{3-5 sentences: key findings, major connections discovered, confidence level}

## Iteration

This skill describes one research cycle. For complex questions, iterate:

1. Run the skill once -- it performs Phase 1-4
2. Read research_state.json to see what's been found and what gaps remain
3. If gaps or unresolved hypotheses remain, continue searching
4. Each pass adds to the state file and report -- never overwrites

See [references/research-loop.md](references/research-loop.md) for the full protocol, state file schema, and completion criteria.

---

## Key Principles

1. **Domain-agnostic**: Follow entities wherever they lead. Don't pre-decide the domain.
2. **Evidence-graded**: Every claim cites its source and tier. No ungraded findings.
3. **Health-aware**: Check tool health before planning. Use fallbacks for broken tools.
4. **Hypothesis-driven**: Don't just collect data -- form and test hypotheses about connections.
5. **Progressive disclosure**: Report grows as research progresses. User sees findings, not search process.
6. **English queries**: All tool calls use English. Respond in the user's language.
